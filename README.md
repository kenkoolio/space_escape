# space_escape

MISSION:
Your rocket ship ran out of fuel and crash landed on a mysterious asteroid floating through space. 
Your sensors have detected a source of plutonium ore, which can be used to power your ship, scattered 
throughout the asteroid's surface. You must scavenge the asteroid in search of plutonium ore for fuel, 
as well as find pieces of your rocket ship that broke off during the crash. Be careful, you never know 
what could be lurking in the shadows...

OBJECTIVE:
You must search the asteroid for 5 pieces of plutonium ore and 5 pieces of your space ship before you 
can fix the ship and leave. Once all material is collected, go to your rocket ship to fix it and blast off.

TIME LIMIT:
You are low on oxygen. You can only take 100 steps before you run out and suffocated in the coldness of 
space. You also start with 100 health points. You only have 4 health packs left that will recover 
10 health points each. If you run out of health, you will die.
